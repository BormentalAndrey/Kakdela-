# Как Дела? — Messenger (project skeleton)
This is a minimal Android project skeleton (stub) for the "Как Дела?" messenger app.
It **is not** a full WhatsApp clone — it's a starting point you can upload to GitHub.
Features included in the skeleton:
- Android app module with a single Activity (main screen with "Как дела?" and button)
- Basic Gradle files
- Resources (layout, strings, colors, styles)
- Local encryption TODO comments for future implementation

Open this project in Android Studio or continue developing locally/CI.

## How to use
1. Unzip and open the folder in Android Studio.
2. Add necessary dependencies, implement P2P messaging, encryption and AI features.
3. Configure Gradle/SDK as needed.
